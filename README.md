# Shipment Discrepancy Tracker

## Overview
Shipment Discrepancy Tracker is a web application that allows users to keep track of shipment issues. This app is generally for business use. It is a frequent occurence for businesses to receive damaged or missing products from their suppliers. Sometimes the items are damaged in shipping, before being shipped, or are mis-shipped. When there is an issue with a shipment, there has to be some communication between the purchaser and the supplier to remedy the situation. Sometimes the damaged goods can really begin to pile up and become difficult for the purchaser to keep track of.

The app will eliminate the need for piles of notes and untracked issues. It is important for the business to have good information to provide to their vendors. Doing this gives the vendors the opportunty to make things right. Otherwise, the purchaser will be eating the cost of damaged or missing items. This is not good for the bottom line of any company!
